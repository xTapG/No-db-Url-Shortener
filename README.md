# Shrt - No db / database URL Shortener

Shrt is a **Javascript** and **HTML** that does not require any type of database, everything is saved in the cloud!

## Storage

At this point you might be asking yourself what does it use to store the urls, it's **not safe at all** so dont shorten urls that contain personal or private information.

There is a very simple answer to that: It's using a free [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) hosting provided by [JSON Box](https://jsonbox.io). **#NotPaidPromotion**

## Demo

You can find the official demo that is owned by me [here](https://shrt.free.bg)!

## Installation

You will only need [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) **(which is awlays included)**.

This project **doesn't** require any other special installations to work (except a [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)).
